# Work in progress: building editions for low-friction reading

We're collaborating with Christopher Blackwell to define a data model for simple tabular data that can then be used to generate low-friction web pages, like [these examples from Furman University](https://furman-university-editions.github.io/Readers/).


Step 1:  [generate a CITE Collection](./cex/) recording every analysis for every token.
